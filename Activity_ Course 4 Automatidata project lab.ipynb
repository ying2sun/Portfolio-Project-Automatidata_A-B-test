Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.\n",

    "1. Through our hypothesis tests, we conclude there is a significant difference in the average total fare amount between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash. And the customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.\n",
    "1. In this case, we can set up some ways to encourage the customer to pay by credit card more than cash. For example:\n",
    "    * Setup a reward for credit card users only.\n",
    "    * Show commercial(s) about credit cards and their rewards in the taxis, so the customers can see the commercial when they take the taxi.\n",
    "    * Design a web app, we can offer special benefits for customers who use the web app to book the service, it will force the customers to use credit cards.\n",

    "#### 1. Consider why this A/B test project might not be realistic, and what assumptions had to be made for this educational project.\n",
    "1. As we mentioned below, even though this project required us to analyze the relationship between `payment_type` and `total_amount`. But since the `total_amount` does not include cash tips, it will be more fair to compare the `fare_amount` instead of `total_amount`.\n",
    "1. If this project is real, we are wondering why the customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash, if the customers are randomly selected and they are required to pay with credit card/cash. Since the `fare_amount` doesn't include the tip amount."
